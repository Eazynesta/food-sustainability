            <h1>About IFJAD</h1>
            <p>The Institute for Food Justice and Development (IFJAD) is a national non-profit organization dedicated to championing food justice and economic development in Kenya by promoting equitable and sustainable food systems.</p>
            <p>We focus on tackling systemic barriers to access safe, adequate, nutritious, and culturally relevant food for all, as well as barriers that prevent meaningful and productive participation in food systems by key players, including smallholder farmers, fishers, and food vendors in the informal sector.</p>
            <p>Our approach combines empowering food systems players by improving knowledge, skills, and practices while simultaneously advocating with policymakers to ensure equity in participation and representation within the food system. By advocating for improved practices and supportive policies, we strive to promote food systems that ensure the delivery of safe, nutritious food while enhancing the economic status of food supply chain workers.</p>
            <p>Our vision is a Kenya where food justice is a reality, and every citizen has equitable access to healthy, culturally significant food and the opportunity to thrive in a resilient and sustainable food system.</p>

            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>To champion fair and equitable food systems and promote economic development for smallholder farmers, fishers, and food vendors in Kenya's informal sector.</p>

            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>To be a leading force for driving transformative change toward inclusive, sustainable, fair, and rewarding food systems.</p>
